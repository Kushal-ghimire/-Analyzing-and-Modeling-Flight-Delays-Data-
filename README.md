- Objective: This assignment will guide students through an end-to-end data analysis project using 
PySpark in Databricks. Students will load, clean, and explore a dataset, perform SQL queries and data 
analysis using Spark SQL, and build a predictive model to classify or regress based on flight delays.

- Dataset: This is a light Delays and Cancellations dataset from Kaggle . This 
dataset contains information on flight delays, cancellations, and causes from different airlines, which 
makes it suitable for exploration, cleaning, and analysis using PySpark.
